The open-source SMCP Library

==Overview==
This library provides a set of C++ classes for generating/interpreting
data packets formatted according to the Spacecraft Monitoring and Control
Protocol (SMCP). For details of the SMCP, please refer a pdf document available
from the url below:

==Install==
Download the archive or checkout the git repository, and place the "SMCPLibrary"
folder anywhere you want. The library consists of header files, and therefore,
no build procedure is required.

When using this library from your application, please add
#include "SMCP.hh"
and, add the path of the "SMCPLibrary/includes" to the include path of
your compiler. For example, if you installed the library to
/usr/local/SMCPLibrary, and the g++ compiler is used, do like below when
compiling:
g++ -I/usr/local/SMCPLibrary/includes your_application.cc


==Documentation==
The documents/ folder contains a Doxygen file which can be used to
generate an API reference in HTML and RTF.
 cd SMCPLibrary/documents
